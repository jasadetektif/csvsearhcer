## SDSS Computing Studies Python Assignment
### Assignment #103 Working with CSV Files

Objectives:
* Read data from a file
* Create a list of lists from a file
* Create searching algorithms for your data
* Use the string.split() to separate a text string literal into a list

CSV (Comma Separated Values) Files are a standard text only way of reading data from a spreadsheet. Each line makes a row of the spreadsheet, and the cells are separated by commas.  This means some cells could be empty by simply putting nothing between the two commas.

##### Problems
* x103a Read the Data
* x103b Store the data as a list of lists
* x103c Search Data
* x103d Update Data
